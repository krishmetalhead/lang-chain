The American Civil War (1861-1865), the deadliest in U.S. history, was primarily caused by the issue of slavery and fought between the North (the Union) and the South (the Confederacy). The Union victory resulted in the abolition of slavery and a strengthened federal government. Civil wars can lead to significant casualties, forced displacement, economic collapse, and profound long-term impacts on society and culture.
